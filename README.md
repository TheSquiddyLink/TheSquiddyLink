## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am an avid coder and Twitch Streamer, I have many projects ranging from Websites, Applications, and Minecraft Mods.
I am part of the [Salmon Pants Crew](https://github.com/SalmonPantsCrew), a group of friends who have been creating content for a few years. 

I would recommend checking out my [OBS Local Website](https://github.com/stars/TheSquiddyLink/lists/obs-local-websites), as these are projects that show up on my streams! 
We also have a website in progress, so feel free to check it out on [GitHub](https://github.com/SalmonPantsCrew/salmonpantscrew.github.io)
